# Odontophobia
Using VR for CBT of Odontophobia (research purposes only!)

Project is built in Unity using version 2017.2.0f3.

The experiment is meant to be run with a VR headset like Oculus Rift (CV) or HTC Vive, and using an xbox-controller for input.
Preferably with the person sitting in a chair. 

The program will at 60s intervals ask the user for an SUD score, these will be saved to a csv file with the date and time in the filename: "Session_04-02-2018_12-25.csv".

Input:

Left and Right triggers are used simultaniously to abort the experiment.
Start button is used to pause the experiment.
A-button is used to input when asked (i.e. SUD input).
Left joystick is used to change value on SUD slider before submitting with A-button.

There is also a tutorial at the start of the program to teach the controls to the user.

You can also use keyboard for these inputs, but this is only recommended for debug purposes.
Keyboard input:

Left and right shift as left and right trigger.
Escape key as start button.
Enter key as A-button.
Arrow keys as left joystick.
